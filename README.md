Every year, numerous brands suffer significant financial losses due to unauthorized knockoff brands and counterfeit products. These products are usually of inferior quality, which can damage the original brand's reputation. Furthermore, consumers often fall victim to these deceptive practices and end up paying exorbitant amounts of money for counterfeit products.

Logos are graphical representations that distinguish a brand's products and services from others. To accurately identify counterfeit or manipulated logos, deep learning algorithms and models can be developed. The proliferation of counterfeit products, online fraud and brand infringement has created a pressing need for such technology. The main goal is to create a system that can analyze visual features and patterns in logo images and classify it as genuine or fake.

Through this technology, businesses and consumers can protect themselves against fraudulent practices, maintain brand trust and make informed purchasing decisions. It will help brands detect and act against the production and sale of counterfeit products, thus safeguarding their reputation and financial interests. Additionally, consumers will be able to quickly identify genuine products, preventing them from falling prey to deceptive practices.
